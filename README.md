SUPerman - an efficient permanent computation library

Step 1: Execute ./build.sh command from within source directory

Step 2: Create a build directory into which build files will be dumped

Step 3: Within the newly created build directory, run following commands successively:
    cmake ..
    make
    
Step 4: Open CALCULATE.txt file and modify this file based on the matrices for which you want to calculate their permanent

Step 5: Within the build directory you created in the Step 2, run ./SUPerman command
